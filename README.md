Problem1- enter 0-10 integer command line parameters (ex. ./a.out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7)
Problem2- pretty easy to run. gives an example
Problem3- tested with an 8% tax rate (0.08) and a $1.00 sales total
Problem4- just needs to be compiled and ran

used cplusplus.com for a few things (reading some documentation), found out about fmod() from the math.h library

The Assignment
By now you should all know how to compile and run C++ programs within a Linux environment, so letâ€™s
keep driving home the basics of the C++ language. Your assignment is to implement the following
programming projects:
Problem 1 (intarray.cpp): Write a program that will read up to ten nonnegative integers into an array
called numberArray and then write/print the integers back to the screen (console output). For this exercise
you need not use any functions.
Problem 2 (zeroboth.cpp): Implement a void function called zeroBoth that has two call-by- reference
parameters, both of which are variables of type int, and sets the values of both variables to 0.
Problem 3 (salestax.cpp): Implement a function called addTax. The function addTax has two formal
parameters: taxRate (float), which is the amount of sales tax expressed as a percent; and cost (float),
which is the cost of an item before tax. The function returns the value (float) of cost so that it includes
sales tax.
Problem 4 (conversion.cpp): Write a program that will read in a length in feet and inches and output the
equivalent length in meters and centimeters. Use at least three functions: one for user input, one or more
for calculating, and one for output(console). Include a loop that lets the user repeat this computation for
new input values until the user says he or she wants to end the program (user has to type exit). There are
0.3048 meters in a foot, 100 centimeters in a meter, and 12 inches in a foot.
So your deliverables are 4 .cpp files and a README.
A README is a text file that includes your name, student id # and any references you used for the
assignment (i.e. textbook, online, colleague).
